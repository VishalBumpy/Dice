# The Game of Dice
The "Game of Dice" is a multiplayer game where N players roll a 6 faced dice in a round-robin
fashion (here, the phone is the Dice). Each time a player rolls the dice (shakes the phone 2-3
times), their points increase by the number (1 to 6) achieved by the roll (displayed on screen).
As soon as a player accumulates M points, they complete the game and are assigned a rank.
Remaining players continue to play the game till they accumulate at least M points. The game
ends when all players have accumulated at least M points.

Rules of the Game
● The order in which the users roll the dice is decided randomly at the start of the game.
● If a player rolls the value "6" then they immediately get another chance to roll again and
move ahead in the game.
● If a player rolls the value "1" two consecutive times then they are forced to skip their next
turn as a penalty.
● A player stops playing the game once at least M points are scored.
